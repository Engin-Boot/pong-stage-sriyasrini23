# Interaction Sequences

## Startup Sequence

The Game module instantiates Paddles and Ball, and calls the initial functions.

## Movement Initiation

The paddle module takes user input and moves the paddle.

The ball moves left and right unless hit by a paddle.

## One score

If paddles miss, opposite one gets a score, and ball comes back to center.
